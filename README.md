# My Daily CodeWars Challenges 

Hi peeps! This is my CodeWars repository where I tackle new CodeWars challenges every day. I want to challenge myself daily and and continue to learn as a coder. 

## What is CodeWars?

CodeWars is a platform that offers coding challenges known as kata. These kata are ranked from 8kyu (beginner) to 1kyu (proficient), based on their difficulty.
